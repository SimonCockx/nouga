\begin{defbox}
Some denotations depend on the type derivation of an expression. For this reason, I will evaluate typing derivations instead of expressions. However, because I only need this in a few cases, I will often omit the derivation, i.e. I will write $|[e|]$ instead of $|[\derivation{D} :: \emptyset |- e : T\ C|]$ if the type $T\ C$ and the derivation $\derivation{D}$ are unimportant.
